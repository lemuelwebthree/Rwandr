Rwandr. A Real World Asset Money Protocol

I am solving the problem of lack of widespread adoption in Africa and throughout the world.

Smart wallets and scaling solutions has innovatively set the stage to onboard the next three billion users
by making thwe onboarding and overall user-experience intuitive and seamless.

My solution to the problem is to increase adoption by making crypto indistinguishable from money and how we already perceive it.

Hence why I created Rwandr. A real world asset money protocol.

I was inspired by the name because I am African, secondly because Base's Around The Wolrd Hackhathon fits perfectly with the African theme 
and the Real World Asset field of web3.

Money and cassh we know it is an asset class and it si a very one! So I, Lemuel Solomon, officially welcome you to Rwandr: Feel The Money!
